!!Removes Response Headers [https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#response-header-filtering]
!In most (99%) Cases, this is what you will need. However won't work if redirects are based on HTML/JS instead of Server Headers (` location: 301/302/anything `)
*##^responseheader(location)
!*##^responseheader(refresh)
!!Removes things like ` <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0 ` from Response Body (HTML/JS)
!!WARNING: Sometimes, this will leak internal domains/ips in HTML/JS Files. Search: ` http-equiv="refresh" ` 
!*##^meta[http-equiv="refresh"]
